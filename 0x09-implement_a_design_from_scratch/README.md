# 0x09 - Implementing A Design From Scratch

![](images_2/headphones_hero_1.jpg)

In this project, we will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. Using all that we've learned previously from HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design concepts.

We are free to implement it the way we want, the objective is to have a fully functional webpage that looks the same as the designer file.
